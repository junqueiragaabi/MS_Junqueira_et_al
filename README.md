Code used to generate the results in Junqueira, MG, Melo AM, Schneck F (2023) [Effects of mesohabitat, grazing and substratum roughness on locally common and rare diatom species](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/fwb.14147), published in Freshweter Biology. 

# Repository structure

## Folders

-   Data: contains all data needed to perform the analysis (anova and db-RDA)

-   R: contains R scripts. Archives that start with the letter D are designed to handle data and analysis, and archivers that start with the letter S
    are designed for figures.

-   Output: contains figures generated with archives contained in script folder that starts with
    letters D and S. Figure 1 was created using inkscape.
